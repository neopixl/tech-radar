# How to use the Technology Radar

### Introduction

Welcome visitor ðŸ‘‹ ! This tech radar aims at providing a clear vision on the technologies we use at [neopixl](https://www.neopixl.com), but also to the technologies we do not recommend in today's mobile applications. It is continuously improved and updated to follow the latest updates on the platforms, on the toolings, and on the librairies themselves.

## How to contribute?

The technologies part of this tech radar are curated by the tech team at neopixl.

### I want to propose a new technology

Everyone at neopixl can propose new technologies, or submit a request through Github issues system. Please read the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTE.md) to see how you can add a new technology.

## License

This technology radar is based on the AoE module available on [Github](https://github.com/AOEpeople/aoe_technology_radar).
