<center><h1>Technology Radar</h1></center>

<center>Welcome visitor ðŸ‘‹ ! This tech radar aims at providing a clear vision on the technologies we use at [neopixl](https://www.neopixl.com), but also to the technologies we do not recommend in today's mobile applications. It is continuously improved and updated to follow the latest updates on the platforms, on the toolings, and on the librairies themselves.</center>
