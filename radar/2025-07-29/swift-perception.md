The Perception library provides tools that mimic @Observable and withObservationTracking in Swift 5.9, but they are backported to work all the way back to iOS 13, macOS 10.15, tvOS 13 and watchOS 6. This means you can start taking advantage of Swift 5.9's observation tools today, even if you can't drop support for older Apple platforms.
