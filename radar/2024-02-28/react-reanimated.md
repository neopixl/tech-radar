React Reanimated is a React Native library that provides a powerful set of APIs for building highly performant and complex animations and gestures. It allows developers to create smooth and interactive animations with native-like performance by leveraging the power of the native animation APIs on both iOS and Android platforms. React Reanimated is particularly useful for creating complex UI interactions, transitions, and animations that require low-level control and optimization.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

- You are building a React Native application and need to implement complex and high-performance animations or gestures.
- You want to create smooth and responsive UI interactions that feel native to the platform.
- You value a library with low-level control over animations and gestures, allowing you to fine-tune performance and optimize for smoothness.
- You prefer to use a declarative and composable API for defining animations and gestures in your React Native components.

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

- Your project does not involve React Native development or does not require complex animations or gestures.
- You prefer to use other animation libraries or native animation APIs that better suit your project's needs.
- You have specific requirements or constraints that are not supported by React Reanimated.
