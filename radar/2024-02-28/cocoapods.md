CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects, primarily used for managing third-party libraries and dependencies in iOS and macOS applications. It simplifies the process of integrating external libraries into Xcode projects by providing a centralized repository of open-source libraries and a straightforward way to install and manage dependencies. CocoaPods also offers features such as version management, dependency resolution, and integration with Xcode workspaces, making it an essential tool for iOS and macOS developers to streamline their development workflow.

CocoaPods should not be used on new projects anymore. Alternative dependency management tools like Swift Package Manager must be used.
