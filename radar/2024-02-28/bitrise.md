Bitrise is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform designed specifically for mobile app development. It provides a streamlined workflow for automating the build, test, and deployment processes of mobile applications across iOS and Android platforms. With Bitrise, developers can easily set up workflows to automatically build, test, and deploy their apps whenever changes are pushed to their version control system. It supports integration with popular version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment platforms, making it an essential tool for mobile app development teams to ensure code quality, reliability, and speed of delivery.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

- You are developing mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms and need a CI/CD solution tailored specifically for mobile app development.
- You want to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of your mobile apps to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.
- You value a cloud-based platform with a user-friendly interface and easy setup for creating and managing CI/CD pipelines.
- You need support for integrating with popular version control systems (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab), testing frameworks (e.g., XCTest, Espresso), and deployment platforms (e.g., App Store, Google Play Store).

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

- Your project does not involve mobile app development or does not require CI/CD automation.
- You prefer to use other CI/CD platforms that offer more features or better integration with your existing tools and infrastructure.
- You have specific requirements or constraints that are not supported by Bitrise.
