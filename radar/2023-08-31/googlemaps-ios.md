Google Maps for iOS is a comprehensive mapping solution developed by Google, offering features like detailed maps, satellite imagery, street view, and route planning. It provides iOS developers with tools to integrate interactive maps into their applications, enabling functionalities such as location services, geocoding, and place search.

### When to use? When not to use?

We strongly recommend to use the native `MapKit` when possible. Relying on a third-party library can be a security and/or maintenance issue when native functionality can easily be the go-to solution.
