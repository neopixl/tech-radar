<p><b>Development language</b></p>
<em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">Apple Documentation</a></em>
<p>Apple's officiel development language. We consider this language to be usable and stable from iOS 15 onwards.
On iOS 14, many aspects must be bypassed or worked around for proper functioning and links must be made with UIKit. 
iOS 16 also brings new non-retro compatible features.
