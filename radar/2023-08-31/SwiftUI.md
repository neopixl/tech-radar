SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit provided by Apple for building declarative user interfaces across all Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It allows developers to describe the layout, appearance, and behavior of their UI using a simple and intuitive syntax, leveraging Swift's expressive language features. SwiftUI promotes a modern and reactive programming paradigm, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive UIs with less code and better readability compared to traditional imperative UI frameworks.
