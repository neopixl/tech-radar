Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React and React Native, offering a minimal API for managing global state. It avoids the boilerplate of Redux, using hooks and a simple store pattern. Zustand supports TypeScript, middleware for persistence, and async actions, making it suitable for small to medium-sized apps.

### Justification for Categorization 
Zustand is categorized as TRIAL due to its growing popularity and simplicity compared to Redux Toolkit. Its minimal API reduces development time, and its small bundle size is ideal for mobile apps. However, it lacks the extensive ecosystem and production testing of Redux Toolkit, making it better suited for smaller projects or teams experimenting with lightweight state management. Developers should trial Zustand in controlled environments to assess its scalability before adopting it for large-scale apps.
