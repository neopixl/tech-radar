React Native Config is a library for managing environment variables in React Native apps. It allows developers to define configuration settings (e.g., API keys, base URLs) in `.env` files, enabling different configurations for development, staging, and production environments. The library supports both iOS and Android, with easy integration into JavaScript or TypeScript codebases.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Config is categorized as ADOPT due to its simplicity and critical role in managing environment-specific configurations. It eliminates the need for hardcoding sensitive data, improving security and maintainability. The library’s compatibility with Expo and its minimal setup overhead make it accessible for teams of all sizes. Its active community and regular updates ensure reliability for production apps. Compared to alternatives like manual configuration or other env libraries, React Native Config’s straightforward approach and widespread use make it a standard choice for React Native projects.
