React Native SVG is a library for rendering scalable vector graphics (SVGs) in React Native apps. It supports creating and manipulating SVG elements like paths, shapes, and gradients using JavaScript. The library is lightweight, supports animations, and integrates well with React Native’s ecosystem, making it ideal for custom icons, illustrations, and charts.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native SVG is categorized as ADOPT due to its critical role in rendering vector graphics, which are essential for modern app design. Its lightweight implementation and compatibility with both platforms ensure high performance and flexibility. The library’s active maintenance and integration with tools like react-native-reanimated for animations make it a reliable choice. Compared to alternatives like raster images or native SVG rendering, React Native SVG offers better scalability and maintainability, justifying its widespread adoption in production apps.
