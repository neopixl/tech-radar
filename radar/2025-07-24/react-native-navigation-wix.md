React Native Navigation (Wix) is a navigation library that uses native navigation components for iOS and Android, offering high performance and platform-specific UI. It supports complex navigation patterns but requires significant native code integration, increasing setup complexity.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Navigation is placed in the HOLD category due to its complexity and declining popularity compared to react-navigation. Its heavy reliance on native code makes it difficult to set up and maintain, especially for smaller teams or projects using Expo. React-navigationâ€™s simpler JavaScript-based approach and broader adoption make it a better choice, relegating this library to HOLD.
