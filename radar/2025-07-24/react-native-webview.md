React Native WebView is a component for rendering web content within React Native apps. It allows developers to embed web pages, display HTML content, or integrate web-based features like payment gateways. The library supports communication between JavaScript and native code, enabling dynamic interactions. It is highly customizable and supports both iOS and Android.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native WebView is placed in the ADOPT category due to its versatility and widespread use in hybrid apps. It enables seamless integration of web content, which is critical for features like in-app browsers or third-party integrations. The library’s active maintenance, compatibility with modern React Native versions, and support for advanced features like JavaScript injection make it reliable. Compared to alternatives like native browser implementations, WebView’s simplicity and cross-platform support make it a standard choice for React Native developers.
