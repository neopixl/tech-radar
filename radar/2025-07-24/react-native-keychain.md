React Native Keychain is a library for securely storing sensitive data, such as credentials and tokens, in the native keychain of iOS and Android devices. It provides a simple API to save, retrieve, and delete data, leveraging platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like iOS Keychain and Android Keystore. The library supports biometric authentication and is widely used for secure data management.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Keychain is placed in the ADOPT category due to its critical role in securing sensitive data in mobile apps. Its integration with native secure storage ensures high security, essential for apps handling user credentials or payment information. The libraryâ€™s maturity, active maintenance, and compatibility with both platforms make it a reliable choice. Compared to alternatives like AsyncStorage for sensitive data, React Native Keychain offers superior security, aligning with modern app requirements. Its widespread adoption in production apps further justifies its ADOPT status.
