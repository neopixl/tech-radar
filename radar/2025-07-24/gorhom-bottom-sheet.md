@gorhom/bottom-sheet is a highly customizable bottom sheet component for React Native, enabling modal-like interfaces that slide up from the bottom of the screen. It supports gestures, snap points, and dynamic content, integrating seamlessly with react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for smooth interactions. The library is lightweight and supports TypeScript.

### Justification for Categorization 
@gorhom/bottom-sheet is placed in the TRIAL category because it offers a modern, performant solution for bottom sheet UIs, which are increasingly popular in mobile apps. Its integration with Reanimated ensures smooth animations, and its customizable API suits various use cases. However, it is relatively new compared to established libraries like react-navigation and lacks the extensive production testing of ADOPT tools. Teams should trial it in non-critical features to evaluate its stability and compatibility with their appâ€™s requirements before full adoption.
