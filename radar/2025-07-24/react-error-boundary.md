React Error Boundary is a library for handling JavaScript errors in React and React Native components. It provides a component to catch errors in the component tree, preventing app crashes and allowing fallback UIs. The library is lightweight and supports TypeScript, improving app robustness.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Error Boundary is placed in the ASSESS category due to its utility in improving app stability, particularly for complex UIs. However, its adoption in React Native is less widespread than in React web, and its effectiveness depends on specific use cases. Teams should assess its impact on error handling and user experience in controlled environments before adopting it widely.
