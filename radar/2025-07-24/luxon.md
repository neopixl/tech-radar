Luxon is a modern JavaScript date and time library built by the Moment.js team, designed to handle date manipulation, formatting, and parsing. It offers a clean, immutable API, supports internationalization, and is optimized for performance. In React Native, Luxon simplifies working with dates across time zones, making it ideal for apps requiring robust date handling.

### Justification for Categorization 
Luxon is placed in the ADOPT category as a superior alternative to Moment.js, which is now in maintenance mode. Its immutable API reduces bugs in complex date manipulations, and its lightweight bundle size is well-suited for mobile apps. Luxon’s support for internationalization and time zone handling makes it a strong fit for global applications. The library’s active maintenance and adoption by modern JavaScript projects ensure long-term viability. Compared to older libraries like Moment.js, Luxon offers better performance and a more modern API, justifying its ADOPT status for React Native developers.
