Lottie for React Native is a library that enables rendering of After Effects animations in real-time. It uses JSON-based animation files (Lottie files) to create smooth, high-quality animations on iOS and Android. The library supports complex animations, interactive controls, and integration with tools like Adobe After Effects, making it ideal for enhancing app visuals.

### Justification for Categorization 
Lottie is categorized as ADOPT due to its widespread use and proven reliability in delivering high-quality animations. Backed by Airbnb, Lottie is actively maintained and supports both platforms seamlessly. Its ability to render complex animations without significant performance overhead makes it ideal for apps prioritizing user experience. Compared to alternatives like GIFs or custom animations, Lottieâ€™s lightweight format and design tool integration streamline development. Its adoption by major apps and robust community support solidify its ADOPT status.
