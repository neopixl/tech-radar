i18next is a powerful internationalization (i18n) framework for JavaScript, widely used in React Native via libraries like react-i18next. It supports translation management, pluralization, interpolation, and context-based translations. i18next is highly configurable, allowing developers to load translations dynamically, handle multiple languages, and integrate with backend services for localization.

### Justification for Categorization 
i18next is categorized as ADOPT because it is a mature, widely adopted solution for internationalization in React Native apps. Its flexibility and extensive feature set make it suitable for apps targeting global audiences. The react-i18next integration simplifies usage in React Native, enabling developers to manage translations efficiently. The library’s active community, regular updates, and support for advanced features like language detection and fallback mechanisms ensure reliability. Compared to alternatives like react-intl, i18next’s broader ecosystem and compatibility with various backends make it a preferred choice for scalable, multilingual apps.
