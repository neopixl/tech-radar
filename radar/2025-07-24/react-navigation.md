React Navigation is a popular, flexible navigation library for React Native, enabling developers to implement stack, tab, drawer, and modal navigation patterns with minimal boilerplate. It leverages native navigation components for iOS and Android, ensuring smooth, platform-specific transitions and gestures. The library supports TypeScript, deep linking, and customizable navigation options, making it suitable for both simple and complex apps. Its modular architecture allows developers to use only the navigators they need, optimizing performance.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Navigation is categorized as ADOPT due to its maturity, widespread adoption, and robust community support. It has been a staple in the React Native ecosystem since its release, backed by a strong open-source community and regular updates. The library addresses critical navigation needs for cross-platform apps, offering a balance of ease of use and performance. Its native integration avoids the pitfalls of JavaScript-based navigation solutions, which can be less performant in large-scale apps. React Navigationâ€™s compatibility with Expo and its extensive documentation make it accessible to developers of all levels. Compared to alternatives like React Native Navigation (Wix), it is less complex to set up and maintain, especially for teams prioritizing rapid development and scalability. Its ability to handle deep linking and URL-based navigation also aligns with modern mobile app requirements, solidifying its place as a go-to solution.
