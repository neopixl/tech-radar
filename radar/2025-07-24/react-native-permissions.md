React Native Permissions is a library for managing runtime permissions in React Native apps. It provides a unified API to request and check permissions (e.g., camera, location, storage) across iOS and Android. The library supports TypeScript, handles platform-specific permission flows, and simplifies compliance with privacy regulations.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Permissions is categorized as ADOPT because it addresses a critical need for handling platform-specific permissions in a unified way. Its robust API simplifies complex permission workflows, ensuring compliance with iOS and Android requirements. The libraryâ€™s active maintenance, TypeScript support, and compatibility with Expo make it a reliable choice for modern apps. Compared to manual permission handling or platform-specific code, React Native Permissions reduces development time and errors, making it a standard tool for production-grade apps.
