React Native Reanimated is a powerful animation library that enables developers to create smooth, performant animations in React Native apps. Unlike traditional JavaScript-based animations, Reanimated runs animations on the native thread, leveraging the UI thread for fluid 60fps performance. It supports declarative animations, gesture-based interactions, and complex transitions using a simple API. Reanimated integrates seamlessly with React Native’s ecosystem, making it ideal for enhancing user interfaces with dynamic effects.

### Justification for Categorization 
Reanimated is placed in the ADOPT category because it has become the de facto standard for animations in React Native. Its second version (Reanimated 2) introduced a more declarative API, addressing earlier complexity concerns and improving developer experience. The library’s ability to offload animations to the native thread ensures high performance, critical for modern mobile apps where user experience is paramount. Reanimated’s integration with libraries like react-native-gesture-handler and its support for both iOS and Android make it versatile. The community’s active maintenance and adoption by major apps (e.g., Shopify) further validate its reliability. Compared to older solutions like Animated API, Reanimated offers superior performance and flexibility, making it a must-have for teams building polished, interactive UIs.
