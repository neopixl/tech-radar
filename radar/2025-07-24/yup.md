Yup is a lightweight, schema-based validation library for JavaScript, commonly used with Formik in React Native apps. It allows developers to define validation schemas for form inputs, supporting complex rules like conditional validation, custom error messages, and nested object validation. Yup’s chainable API is intuitive, and its TypeScript support ensures type-safe validation logic.

### Justification for Categorization 
Yup earns its ADOPT status due to its seamless integration with Formik and its role as a go-to validation library in the React Native ecosystem. Its lightweight footprint and expressive API make it ideal for mobile apps where performance is critical. Yup’s ability to handle complex validation scenarios, such as asynchronous validation and schema composition, makes it versatile for various use cases. The library’s maturity, active maintenance, and widespread adoption by developers building production-grade apps justify its placement. Compared to custom validation logic or other libraries, Yup’s simplicity and robustness make it a preferred choice for ensuring data integrity in forms.
