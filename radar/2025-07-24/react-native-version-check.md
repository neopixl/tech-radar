React Native Version Check is a library for checking app versions and prompting users to update. It supports fetching version information from app stores (Google Play, App Store) and provides APIs to compare versions and trigger updates. The library is lightweight and cross-platform.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Version Check is placed in the ASSESS category due to its utility for ensuring app updates, a common requirement for production apps. However, its niche focus and limited adoption compared to core libraries suggest it needs further evaluation. Teams should assess its reliability and integration with app store APIs before considering it for production.
