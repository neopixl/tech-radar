React Native Tracking Transparency is a library for managing iOS App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permissions, required for user tracking since iOS 14.5. It provides APIs to request tracking permissions and check authorization status, ensuring compliance with Appleâ€™s privacy policies.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Tracking Transparency is categorized as HOLD because its scope is limited to iOS-specific tracking permissions, which are niche and less relevant for apps not requiring user tracking. Its limited adoption and the availability of alternative permission libraries like react-native-permissions make it less essential. Teams should avoid relying on it unless specifically targeting iOS tracking features.
