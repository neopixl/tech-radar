Moment.js is a JavaScript library for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates. It was widely used in React Native apps for date handling but has been succeeded by modern alternatives like Luxon. Moment.js supports a wide range of date operations but is known for its large bundle size and mutable API.

### Justification for Categorization 
Moment.js is categorized as HOLD because it is in maintenance mode, with its maintainers recommending alternatives like Luxon or date-fns for new projects. Its large bundle size and mutable API are less suitable for modern React Native apps, where performance and immutability are critical. While still functional, its lack of active development and performance drawbacks make it a poor choice for new projects compared to ADOPT libraries like Luxon.
