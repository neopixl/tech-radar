React Native Bootsplash is a library for creating custom splash screens in React Native apps. It provides a simple API to display branded loading screens during app startup, supporting animations and platform-specific configurations. The library is lightweight and compatible with both iOS and Android.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Bootsplash is categorized as ASSESS because it addresses a common need for polished app startup experiences but lacks the widespread adoption of ADOPT libraries. Its simplicity is promising, but its limited scope and newer status warrant caution. Teams should assess its performance and ease of integration in non-critical features before broader use.
