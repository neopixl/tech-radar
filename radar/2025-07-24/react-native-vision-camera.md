React Native Vision Camera is a modern camera library for React Native, offering high-performance access to device cameras. It supports features like photo capture, video recording, barcode scanning, and real-time processing with plugins. Built with native performance in mind, it integrates with TypeScript and modern React Native versions.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Vision Camera is categorized as TRIAL due to its advanced capabilities and performance advantages over older libraries like react-native-camera. Its plugin-based architecture and support for real-time processing make it promising for complex camera use cases. However, its relative newness and ongoing development suggest it should be trialed in specific features to ensure stability and compatibility before full adoption.
