React Native Keyboard Controller is a library for managing keyboard behavior in React Native apps. It provides hooks and components to handle keyboard events, adjust layouts, and prevent issues like content being obscured by the keyboard. The library is lightweight and supports TypeScript.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Keyboard Controller is categorized as ASSESS due to its potential to simplify keyboard-related challenges, a common pain point in mobile apps. However, its newer status and limited adoption compared to core React Native APIs suggest it needs further evaluation. Teams should assess its effectiveness in handling complex keyboard interactions before considering it for production.
