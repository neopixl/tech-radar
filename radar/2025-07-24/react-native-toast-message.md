React Native Toast Message is a library for displaying toast notifications in React Native apps. It provides a simple API to show customizable, cross-platform toasts with animations. The library supports TypeScript, theming, and various toast types (e.g., success, error), making it easy to integrate into apps for user feedback.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Toast Message is placed in the TRIAL category due to its ease of use and growing adoption for displaying notifications. It offers a lightweight alternative to platform-specific toast solutions, with good customization options. However, its relatively recent emergence and limited use in large-scale apps warrant caution. Teams should trial it for non-critical feedback mechanisms to evaluate its performance and reliability before broader adoption.
