Flipper is a debugging and profiling tool for React Native, providing insights into app performance, network requests, and component trees. It integrates with React Native apps to offer a desktop interface for debugging, with plugins for logs, crashes, and more. Flipper is maintained by Meta.

### Justification for Categorization
Flipper is placed in the HOLD category due to its declining relevance in the React Native ecosystem. While it offers robust debugging features, its setup complexity and performance overhead make it less appealing compared to modern alternatives like React Native Debugger or browser-based DevTools. Its limited adoption and maintenance concerns, especially for smaller teams, justify its HOLD status.
