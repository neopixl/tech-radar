Redux Form is a library for managing form state in Redux-based React and React Native apps. It integrates form state with Redux, providing utilities for validation, submission, and field management. However, it adds significant complexity and boilerplate compared to modern alternatives.

### Justification for Categorization 
Redux Form is categorized as HOLD because it is outdated and overly complex compared to modern form libraries like Formik. Its tight coupling with Redux introduces unnecessary overhead, especially for apps using lighter state management solutions. Formikâ€™s simpler API and broader adoption make it a better choice, rendering Redux Form obsolete for new projects.
