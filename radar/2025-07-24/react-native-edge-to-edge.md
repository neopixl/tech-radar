React Native Edge-to-Edge is a library for handling edge-to-edge layouts on modern Android and iOS devices. It simplifies adapting UIs to devices with notches, rounded corners, and dynamic status bars, ensuring content renders correctly across screen types. The library is lightweight and integrates with React Nativeâ€™s layout system.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Edge-to-Edge is placed in the ASSESS category due to its relevance for modern device compatibility, particularly with newer Android and iOS designs. However, its niche focus and limited adoption make it less proven than ADOPT libraries. Teams should assess its impact on UI consistency and performance in projects targeting diverse devices before considering it for production.
