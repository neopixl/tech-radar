Formik is a form management library for React and React Native, simplifying the process of handling form state, validation, and submission. It provides a declarative API to manage form inputs, errors, and touched states, reducing boilerplate code. Formik integrates seamlessly with validation libraries like Yup, supports TypeScript, and handles complex form scenarios like dynamic fields and conditional validation.

### Justification for Categorization 
Formik is placed in the ADOPT category because it is a battle-tested solution for form management in React Native apps. Its simplicity and flexibility make it ideal for both small and large projects, allowing developers to handle complex form logic without excessive overhead. The library’s integration with Yup for validation and its compatibility with React Native’s input components ensure a smooth developer experience. Formik’s active community and extensive documentation further solidify its reliability. Compared to alternatives like React Hook Form, Formik’s mature ecosystem and widespread use in production apps make it a safer choice for teams prioritizing stability and proven performance.
