@shopify/restyle is a styling library for React Native, developed by Shopify, that provides a type-safe, theme-based approach to styling. It allows developers to define reusable style systems with utilities for spacing, typography, and colors, improving consistency across components. The library supports TypeScript and dynamic theming.

### Justification for Categorization 
@shopify/restyle is categorized as ASSESS because it offers a modern, scalable approach to styling, particularly for large teams. Its backing by Shopify adds credibility, but its adoption is less widespread than NativeWind or StyleSheet. Teams should assess its integration and performance in projects requiring consistent UI design before adopting it fully.
