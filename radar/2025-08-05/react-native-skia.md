React Native Skia is a library that brings Skia, a high-performance 2D graphics engine, to React Native. It enables rendering of complex graphics, animations, and custom UI elements with near-native performance. Skia supports advanced features like shaders, vector graphics, and text rendering, making it ideal for visually rich apps.

### Justification for Categorization 
React Native Skia is categorized as ASSESS because it is a powerful but emerging tool in the React Native ecosystem. Its ability to leverage Skiaâ€™s graphics engine offers unmatched performance for complex visuals, but its early stage of development and limited adoption raise concerns about stability and community support. Teams should assess its capabilities in proof-of-concept projects to evaluate its potential for specific use cases before considering broader adoption.
