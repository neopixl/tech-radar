Redux Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit) is a state management library designed to simplify Redux usage in React and React Native applications. It provides utilities like `createSlice` and `configureStore` to reduce boilerplate, making state management more efficient. With built-in support for TypeScript, async thunks for data fetching, and immutable state updates, Redux Toolkit streamlines complex state logic while maintaining predictability and scalability.

### Justification for Categorization 
Redux Toolkit is categorized as ADOPT due to its role as the modern standard for Redux-based state management. It addresses long-standing complaints about Redux’s complexity by offering a streamlined API that reduces code verbosity while retaining Redux’s strengths, such as predictable state updates and debugging tools like Redux DevTools. For React Native apps, especially those with complex or data-intensive requirements, Redux Toolkit provides a robust solution for managing global state across components. Its widespread adoption, active maintenance, and compatibility with TypeScript make it a safe choice for enterprise-grade apps. Compared to alternatives like Zustand, Redux Toolkit is better suited for larger teams needing standardized state management practices, justifying its ADOPT status.
