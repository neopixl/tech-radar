### Network Library

Alamofire is a popular networking library for iOS and macOS development. It provides an elegant interface for making network requests and handling responses in Swift.

With Alamofire, developers can easily perform tasks like making HTTP requests, handling authentication, uploading and downloading files, and parsing JSON responses. It abstracts away the complexities of network programming, making it easier to write clean, concise code for networking tasks in Swift-based applications.

Alamofire is widely used in the iOS and macOS development communities and is known for its reliability, performance, and extensive feature set.

### When to use? When not to use?

We strongly recommend to use the native network methods included in `Foundation` when possible. Relying on a third-party library can be a security and/or maintenance issue when native functionality can easily be the go-to solution.
