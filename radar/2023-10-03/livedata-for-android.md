<p>LiveData is an Android class that represents observable data. It is designed for use in Android applications to simplify data management and view updating.</p>

<p>LiveData is an observable, which means it can be observed by other objects in the application. When LiveData data is updated, objects observing it are automatically notified. This allows developers to avoid having to deal with manually updating views.</p>

<p>LiveData is also lifecycle sensitive. This means that it is automatically deleted when its activity or fragment is destroyed. This helps prevent memory leaks.</p>
