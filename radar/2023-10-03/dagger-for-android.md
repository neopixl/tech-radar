<p>Dagger is a dependency injection framework for Java and Kotlin. It is designed to simplify application development by centralizing dependency management.</p>

<p>Dagger works by creating instances of classes based on their dependencies. Dependencies can be classes, interfaces or functions. They can also be injected into properties, methods or constructors.</p>

<p>Using a more recent framework such as Hilt or Koin is recommended.</p>
