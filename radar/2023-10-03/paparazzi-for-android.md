<em><a href="https://cashapp.github.io/paparazzi/">Official documentation</a></em>
<p>Paparazzi is an Android library that allows you to render screenshots of your apps without having to deploy them to a physical device. This can be useful for debugging, development and testing.</p>

<p>Paparazzi works by capturing the screen of your Android device using the View.captureViewScreenshot() API. This API supports screenshot of individual views or the entire screen.</p>
