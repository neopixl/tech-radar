<p>
Coroutines can be used to implement a variety of asynchronous tasks, such as:

- Network Operations
- Database queries
- File I/O
- Long-term calculations
</p>

<p>
Coroutines are also useful for implementing concurrency models, such as producer-consumer and actors.

<h2>Advantages of Kotlin coroutines</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lightweight: Coroutines do not require a separate stack for each coroutine, making them much more efficient than threads.</li>
<li>Concurrent: Coroutines can run concurrently, which can improve the performance of your application.</li>
<li>Expressive: Coroutines provide a concise and expressive way to write asynchronous code.</li>
<li>Easy to use: Coroutines are easy to use, even for beginners.</li>
</ul>
