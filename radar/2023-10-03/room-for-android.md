Room is a persistence library for Android that allows developers to create SQLite databases easily and efficiently. It provides an abstraction over SQLite, meaning developers do not need to know the details of manipulating SQLite to create and manage databases.

Room offers a variety of features to make creating and managing SQLite databases easier, including:

<li>Migration Management: Room automatically manages database migrations, allowing developers to update their databases without having to lose data.
<li>Integration with LiveData: Room integrates with LiveData, allowing developers to display database data in their user interface in a responsive manner.
<li>Integration with ViewModel: Room integrates with ViewModel, allowing developers to keep database data in memory for the life of the activity or coroutine.
