<h1>RXJava for Android</h1>

<p>RXJava is a reactive programming library for Java and Kotlin. It allows developers to write applications that respond to data changes in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner.</p>

<p>RXJava is a powerful library that can be used for a variety of tasks, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating observables</li>
<li>Transformation of observables</li>
<li>Error handling</li>
<li>Creating responsive views</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not recommend the use of RXJava. Coroutines and flows are preferred.</p>
