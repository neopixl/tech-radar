<p>Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a framework that allows you to develop cross-platform applications in Kotlin. It allows developers to share Kotlin code between Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows and web applications.</p>

<p>KMP works by generating native code for each target platform. This allows KMP apps to deliver performance and user experience comparable to native apps.</p>
