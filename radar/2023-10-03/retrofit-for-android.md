<p>Retrofit is a networking library for Android that allows developers to create REST APIs simply and efficiently. It provides abstraction over HTTP, meaning developers do not need to know the details of manipulating HTTP to create and manage REST APIs.</p>

<p>Retrofit offers a variety of features to make creating and managing REST APIs easier, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request management</li>
<li>Response management</li>
<li>Integration with Gson</li>
</ul>

<p>To use Retrofit, developers must create a service interface. The service interface defines the methods that will be used to access REST API resources.</p>
