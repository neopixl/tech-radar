<p>SQLDelight is a Kotlin framework that allows you to generate type-safe APIs for SQLite databases. It is designed for use in Android applications, but can also be used in other contexts.</p>

<p>SQLDelight works by generating Kotlin classes from SQLite database schemas. These classes provide methods for performing database operations, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and selecting data.</p>

<p>Benefits of SQLDelight for Android</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Better security</b>: SQLDelight helps reduce the risk of SQL query errors, because queries are generated automatically and type-safely.</li>
<li><b>Better productivity</b>: SQLDelight saves time by generating database APIs from schemas.</li>
<li><b>Better testability</b>: SQLDelight makes it easier to create unit and integration tests because the database APIs are type-safe.</li>
</ul>
