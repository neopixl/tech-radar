Proxyman is a native macOS application that enables developers and testers to capture, inspect, and manipulate HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It offers features like Breakpoint, Map Local, and Scripting for real-time analysis and modification of API requests and responses. This helps in testing and debugging mobile and web applications by simulating various scenarios.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* You need to analyze or modify API requests/responses for mobile or web apps in real-time.
* You need to test edge cases or replicate hard-to-reproduce scenarios by manipulating API traffic.
* You want tools like Breakpoint (pause and edit), Map Local (replace responses locally), or Scripting (automate modifications).
* You are looking for a native macOS tool for HTTP/HTTPS debugging.

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your primary development environment is not macOS.
* You do not require detailed HTTP/HTTPS traffic inspection or manipulation.
* Simpler browser-based developer tools meet your debugging needs.
* You require a cross-platform solution.
