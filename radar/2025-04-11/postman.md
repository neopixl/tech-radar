Postman is a comprehensive API platform for building, testing, documenting, and sharing APIs. It simplifies each step of the API lifecycle, from design and mocking to automated testing and monitoring. Postman enables individual developers and teams to collaborate effectively on API development.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* You are developing or consuming APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.).
* You need to test API endpoints thoroughly, including automated testing.
* You need to create, maintain, and publish API documentation easily.
* Collaboration around API design, development, and testing is important.
* You want to manage the entire API lifecycle in one platform.

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your project does not involve API development or consumption.
* Simple command-line tools like cURL are sufficient for your API interaction needs.
* You are primarily focused on UI testing rather than API testing.
