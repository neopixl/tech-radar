Apidog is an integrated collaboration platform for API documentation, debugging, mocking, and automated testing. It aims to combine functionalities often found in separate tools (like Postman + Swagger + Mock + JMeter) into a single application, streamlining the API lifecycle from design to testing.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* You are looking for an all-in-one platform for API design, documentation, testing, and mocking.
* You want to automatically generate interactive API documentation from your API definitions.
* Real-time collaboration on API development is important.
* You need features like integrated mocking and automated testing alongside API design and debugging.

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* You are already heavily invested in and satisfied with separate tools for different parts of the API lifecycle (e.g., Postman for testing, Swagger for documentation).
* Your project does not involve API development.
* You prefer a more modular approach using specialized tools rather than an integrated platform.
