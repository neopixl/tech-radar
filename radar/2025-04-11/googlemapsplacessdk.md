The Google Maps Places SDK for iOS allows developers to build location-aware applications using Google's extensive database of places. It provides features like finding nearby places, getting place details (address, phone number, type, photos), place search based on text queries, and autocompleting place names/addresses as users type.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* Your iOS application needs to display information about real-world places (businesses, points of interest, geographic locations).
* You require features like searching for nearby places, detailed information lookup, or place autocompletion.
* You want to leverage Google's comprehensive global places data.
* You need to integrate place selection or discovery features within your app's map or UI.

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your application does not require location-based features or place information.
* You are using an alternative mapping or places provider (e.g., Apple MapKit, Mapbox, Mappls).
* The pricing model or terms of service for Google Maps Platform do not align with your project needs.
* Basic map display (provided by MapKit or Google Maps SDK for iOS without Places) is sufficient.
