Batch is a customer engagement platform designed for sending personalized push notifications (mobile & web), In-App messages, SMS, and emails at scale. It allows marketers to centralize customer data, orchestrate multi-channel communication scenarios (triggered, recurring, one-shot), manage marketing pressure, and analyze campaign performance.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* You need to engage users via mobile push (iOS/Android) or web push notifications.
* You require a multi-channel engagement strategy involving Push, In-App messages, SMS, or Email.
* You need to personalize communication based on user data (attributes, events) and behavior.
* Automating communication workflows (e.g., onboarding, re-engagement, transactional messages) is important.
* You want features like A/B testing, segmentation, frequency capping, and analytics for campaigns.
* You need to manage user opt-ins and data privacy (GDPR compliant).

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your application does not require push notifications or other forms of direct user engagement.
* A simpler, single-channel notification solution is sufficient for your needs.
* You are already heavily invested in a different CRM or Marketing Automation platform that fulfills these requirements.
* The project scope or budget does not warrant a dedicated customer engagement platform.
