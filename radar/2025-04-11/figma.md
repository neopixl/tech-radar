Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that runs in the browser and via desktop apps. It encompasses Figma Design for creating and testing UI/UX, FigJam for online whiteboarding, and Dev Mode for handoff to developers. It allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on design files, prototypes, and design systems.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* You need to design user interfaces and prototypes for websites, mobile apps, or other digital products.
* Real-time collaboration between designers, developers, product managers, and other stakeholders is crucial.
* You need a platform for creating and maintaining design systems.
* You require tools for brainstorming and diagramming (FigJam).
* You want to streamline the design-to-development handoff process (Dev Mode).

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your project does not involve digital interface design (e.g., backend-only projects).
* You primarily need a tool for graphic design (illustrations, photo editing) rather than UI/UX design.
* Offline-only work is a strict requirement (though Figma has desktop apps, its core is cloud-based).
