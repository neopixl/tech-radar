Lokalise is a translation management system (TMS) designed for agile teams. It helps automate the localization workflow for web and mobile apps, games, and software. It provides tools for developers, translators, and project managers to collaborate on translating and managing multilingual content.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* Your application or software needs to support multiple languages.
* You want to automate and streamline the translation and localization process.
* Collaboration between developers, translators, and project managers is needed for localization.
* You require integrations with development workflows and tools (e.g., via API).

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your application only needs to support a single language.
* Manual file handling for translations is sufficient for your scale.
* You are using a different, established translation management system that meets your needs.
