GuardSquare provides mobile application protection solutions, specializing in shielding iOS and Android apps against reverse engineering and hacking. Their products (like DexGuard for Android and iXGuard for iOS) offer advanced code obfuscation and runtime application self-protection (RASP) features.

#### Should be used in a new project if:

* Your mobile application (Android/iOS) contains sensitive intellectual property or handles critical data.
* You need to protect your app against reverse engineering, tampering, or cloning.
* You require advanced code obfuscation and runtime protection features.
* Security is a critical requirement for your mobile application (e.g., finance, healthcare, high-value games).

#### Should not be used in a new project if:

* Your mobile application has low security requirements or does not contain sensitive IP/data.
* Basic code shrinking and optimization provided by standard build tools (like R8/ProGuard) are sufficient.
* The cost and complexity of integrating advanced security tools are prohibitive for the project.
