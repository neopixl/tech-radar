Guardsquare offers comprehensive security for mobile applications. Its products, DexGuard for Android and iXGuard for iOS, protect apps from tampering and reverse engineering using advanced code obfuscation and runtime self-protection (RASP). Additionally, Guardsquare's AppSweep tool helps developers find and fix security vulnerabilities in their apps and SDKs, integrating directly into DevOps workflows to keep projects on schedule. Additionally, Guardsquare's ThreatCast monitors your apps in real-time and continuously improve your security implementation with ThreatCastâ€™s actionable feedback.

#### Should be mandatory in a new project if:

* Your mobile application (Android/iOS) contains sensitive intellectual property or handles critical data.
* You need to protect your app against reverse engineering, tampering, or cloning.
* You require advanced code obfuscation and runtime protection features.
* Security is a critical requirement for your mobile application (e.g., finance, healthcare, high-value games).

#### Should be optional in a new project if:

* Your mobile application has low security requirements or does not contain sensitive IP/data.
* Basic code shrinking and optimization provided by standard build tools (like R8/ProGuard) are sufficient.
