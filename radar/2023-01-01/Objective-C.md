### Development Language

Objective-C is a programming language commonly used for macOS and iOS app development. It's been a staple in the Apple development ecosystem for decades. However, its usage has been overshadowed by Swift, Apple's newer programming language.

Objective-C's syntax and conventions can be seen as outdated compared to Swift. Swift offers modern features, better performance, and safer coding practices. Additionally, Apple has been actively promoting Swift and integrating it into its development tools and frameworks. Consequently, for new iOS projects, Swift is generally preferred over Objective-C due to its advantages in readability, safety, and compatibility with the latest Apple technologies.
